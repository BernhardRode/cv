When I'm not coding or tackling work challenges, I'm hanging out with my wife and our two little girls. Outside of family time, you can find me cheering on my favorite sports team (let's go stuttgart), hitting  mountain bike trails, or unwinding with a good video game (because everyone needs a little downtime, right?).",
