## Welcome to the Buzzword Bonanza!

While technical skills are important, sometimes it's the right lingo that gets your foot in the door. Let's see how many squares we can fill:

| Category | Cloud Native | Development | Process & Methodology | Extra Credit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure | Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) | CI/CD Pipelines | Agile (Scrum, Kanban) | Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation) |
| Development | Microservices Architecture | API Management | Test-Driven Development (TDD) | Version Control (Git) |
| Data | Cloud Storage (S3, Azure Blob Storage) | Big Data Analytics | Data Warehousing | Data Visualization (Tableau, Power BI) |
| Security | Cloud Security (IAM, KMS) | Secure Coding Practices | Threat Modeling | Penetration Testing Experience |
| Soft Skills | Communication | Collaboration | Problem-Solving | Time Management |

**Bonus Round:**  As an extroverted nerd, I believe in clear and direct communication. No hidden agendas here, just a passion for tech and a willingness to share what I know. Let's geek out and solve some problems together!
